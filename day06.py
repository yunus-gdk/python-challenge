# Write a function called user_name that generates a username
# from the user’s email. The code should ask the user to input an
# email and the code should return everything before the @ sign
# as their user name.
# For example, if someone enters ben@gmail.com,
# the code should return ben as their user name.


def user_name():
  email = input("Enter an email address: ")
  username = email.split("@")
  print(username[0])


user_name()
