# Write a function called make_tuples that takes two lists,
# equal lists, and combines them into a list of tuples.
# For example, if list a is [1,2,3,4] and list b is [5,6,7,8],
# your function should return [(1,5), (2,6), (3,7), (4,8)].


def make_tuples(*args):
  # print(len(args))
  # print(len(args[0]))
  list1 = args[0]
  list2 = args[1]
  while i < len(args[0]):
    tupple


make_tuples([1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8])
